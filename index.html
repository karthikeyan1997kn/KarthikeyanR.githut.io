								<h2 class="major">ABOUT ME</h2>
								<p>My passion for numbers and data analysis has shaped my journey and career trajectory. I graduated from Thiruvalluvar University (Sanghamam arts and science college) with a Bachelore's degree in Computer Applications.</a>.</p>
								<p>My experience as an MIS Executive for five years in fields such as pharma, medicine, sales, and manufacturing Products has provided me with strong knowledge of real-time work structures and domain-specific challenges. Through problem-solving, creating dashboards, and analyzing sales data using Excel, I have honed my skills and expertise. This experience has helped me seamlessly transition into an advanced data analyst role, allowing me to work on numerous projects and continuously expand my knowledge.My role as an MIS Executive allowed me to delve deeper into reporting and data analysis. This position challenged me to upgrade my skills and knowledge in data analysis, providing me with valuable experience in creating reports and deriving insights from complex datasets. This role played a significant part in strengthening my expertise in data analysis.</p>
								<p>To further develop my skills, I pursued a Data Analyst course at Besant Technology while working on projects related to my previous domains in pharma, medicine, and manufacturing productivity. This course allowed me to deepen my expertise in data analysis and advanced analytics. addition to my professional experience, I've completed over 30 personal projects utilizing SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel, and Tableau. These projects include exploring data (EDA), web scraping, Medical Billing Optimizing, optimizing customer engagement, and creating insightful dashboards.</p>
								<p>In addition to my coursework, I completed more than 10 internships at various organizations such as 360 DigiTMG, CognoRise, and MeriSkills. These internships provided me with valuable hands-on experience in different industries and further honed my skills in data analysis. I believe data is not just about numbers; it's about effective communication and storytelling. So i Participated some Webinar session and offline interactinve meetup to present thoughts of data doamain. I share my passion for data analysis through my blog, "datawithkarthikeyanr," where I make data analysis approachable and relatable for everyone. Through my blog, I aim to demystify data and show that it can be a fun and powerful tool for understanding the world.</p>
								<P>Beyond data, my artistic perspective allows me to see the bigger picture and discover meaning beyond the numbers. My business knowledge empowers me to analyze what businesses need and provide actionable insights. My background in computer applications and realtime working experiece has equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills, while my experience as a volunteer has honed my communication abilities.
